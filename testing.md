## Unit Test Documentation

We created a unit test file called `test_diagnosis.py` to test the `DiagnosisAnalyzer` class.

### Target Function
We focused on `compute_summary_counts()` because it performs calculations on filtered data and can break if certain expected groups are missing.

### Why It Might Fail
If any of the groups "Precancerous", "NMSC", or "Melanoma" are missing, a `KeyError` can occur. We added exception handling to avoid this.

### Test Cases Implemented

1. All Groups Present  
   - Tests the function with all 3 expected diagnosis groups.  
   - Asserts that output contains all 3.

2. Missing Group  
   - Simulates a situation where one or more expected groups are missing.  
   - Verifies the function handles this without crashing.

3. Multiple Diagnoses Detection  
   - Tests the `find_multiple_diagnoses()` method to confirm correct grouping.

4. Empty Diagnosis Filtered  
   - Ensures that if no data is available, the function returns an empty DataFrame instead of failing.
