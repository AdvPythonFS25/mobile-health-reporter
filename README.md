The Sun Bus is a mobile dermatology clinic providing free cancer screenings across various US cities. Out project aims to build a reporting tool that helps The Sun Bus analyse screening data, identify trends in diagnoses and generate both city-specific and cumulative reports.

# Objectives
Correlate screening events (city) with county-level data and rural/urban classification (using MUI).

Generate the following statistics:
Number of suspicious lesions diagnosed,
Distribution of cases by region and rurality,
Patients with multiple diagnoses,
Allow continuous integration of new screening event data,
Produce individual city reports and an evolving cumulative summary,
Provide data visualisations for trends over time and geography.

# Datasets
EHR data: patient demographics, visit date, diagnosis information.
City-county mapping: US cities and their corresponding counties (from: https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities).
Medically Underserved Index (MUI): rural/urban classification by county (from: https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/data-explorer).
Tools: Python, GitHub for version control, Markdown for documentation

# Target Users
Sun Bus Team (healthcare providers and analysts who require streamlined and up-to-date reports from mobile dermatology screenings), as well as other mobile clinics who can modify and use the tool for their benefit.
